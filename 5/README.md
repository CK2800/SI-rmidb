## _Research and describe the difference between SOA and SaaS_

&nbsp;

### Software Oriented Architecture (SOA).

SOA is an **architectural model for designing an application using a composition of services** rather than e.g. functions in a facade.

This way, each service can be used by other clients. Each client may use a service and combine it with others in a so-called composition of services.

Thus every service can be seen as a logical unit from the clients perspective. The providers of these services are then able to further evolve these irrespective of the evolution of other services, as they are not reliant on each other.

This is a high level principle of SoC. How the client may choose to combine the services is of no interest to each individual service. They just need the client to fulfill a contract, much like when a client makes use of a method by providing it parameters according to the methods signature.

### Software as a Service (SaaS).

**SaaS is a method to deliver software to end users.**

Using SaaS a company will host its applications in the cloud. This way the end user will no longer have to install the application on a computer. All that is needed is a connection to the application host.

Moreover the end user may not need to run an underlying operating system required by the application, the host will run it instead. Naturally, this opens up the application to a broader audience and increases market potential.
